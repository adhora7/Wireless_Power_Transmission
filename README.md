## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)** system that uses inductive coupling to wirelessly transfer power to an LED. The system utilizes a transmitter coil that generates a high-frequency magnetic field, which is captured by a receiver coil and converted back into electrical power. This concept has significant applications in mobile charging, electric vehicles, and medical devices.

## Key Components:
- **Transmitter Coil**
- **Receiver Coil**
- **LED**
- **Transistor**
- **Resistors**
- **PCB**
